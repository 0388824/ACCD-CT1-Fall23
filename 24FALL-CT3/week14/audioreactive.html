        <h1>Audio Reactive</h1>
        <p>I replicated the visual from the tutorial video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLebV9rjqb4" target="_blank">here</a> and adapted it to respond dynamically to the audio playing on my laptop using Loopback software. I customized the original visual to better align with house music by enhancing its responsiveness to the audioâ€™s rhythm and intensity. My intention was to reflect the energy of musical build-ups and drops, and the strong vibration from bass.</p>
