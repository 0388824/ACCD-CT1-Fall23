        <h2>Project Brief & Responses</h2>
        <p><em>Synthetic Relationships</em> explores fundamental communication through two electronic beings, "Creature 1" and "Creature 2," in a predator-prey dynamic. Using sensory data and a network via io.adafruit, they interact and respond to each other’s actions.</p>

            <h3>Responses to Brief Questions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Are both creatures in the same environment?</strong> Yes, both interact within the same environment, activating based on shared light conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Do their "worldviews" differ?</strong> Yes, Creature 2 detects light, while Creature 1 detects distance to the bird.</li>
                <li><strong>Are they stationary or mobile?</strong> Both are stationary, engaging dynamically through sensory and motor actions.</li>
                <li><strong>How is sensory data processed?</strong> Each creature processes data relevant to its sensory role—light or distance, triggering reactions in the other.</li>
                <li><strong>How is communication encoded?</strong> Communication is transmitted to io.adafruit for real-time data exchange.</li>
                <li><strong>Will the transmission be continuous or intermittent?</strong> Transmission is intermittent, creating a dynamic interaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Is the communication perceptible to outsiders?</strong> Yes, observers can see the bird’s motion and feel Creature 1’s vibration.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Behavioral Sequence Description -->
        <h3>Behavioral Sequence</h3>
        <p>
            When Creature 2 is active, Creature 1 receives the light data and reacts by starting its vibrator, indicating readiness to "search." Creature 1’s distance sensor begins monitoring the cardboard bird’s position. The sensor value is continuously shared on io.adafruit, enabling Creature 2 to "respond" based on the distance.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Predator-Prey Cycle:</strong> If Creature 1 detects the bird within a certain range, Creature 2's motor spins, lowering the bird to simulate hiding. As the distance increases (when Creature 1 no longer detects the bird), Creature 2 raises the cardboard again. This back-and-forth interaction repeats, simulating a chase dynamic reminiscent of predator and prey.</p>

        <h2>Making Process</h2>
        <p><strong>Calibration:</strong> Light and distance thresholds were adjusted for accurate activation.</p>
        <p><strong>Testing & Refinement:</strong> Sensor and motor timings were iteratively improved to create a smooth interaction.</p>
        <p><strong>Technical Challenges:</strong> Io.adafruit was fine-tuned to handle latency, enabling responsive interaction.</p>
