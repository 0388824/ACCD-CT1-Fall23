        <h1>Digital materiality</h1>
        <p>I've always been a big fan of progressive house, so I try to use the audio-responsive features in TouchDesigner to create videos that gradually progress with the music. I followed the tutorials online to create some cool patterns, then used the audio analysis CHOP to assign values to the shapes.</p>
        <p>For the first video, I created a cool pattern using the Line SOP, and then I employed the particle system to develop a pattern. I assigned the audio values to the Transform SOP to make the pattern respond to the audio.</p>

        <p>For the second video, I followed a tutorial to create a sphere polygon, and used the Primitive CHOP to extract numbers from the audio analysis to adjust its scale and position.</p>

        <p>For the third video, I first created a wave pattern, then used the line function to assign different colors using the near and far distance function. I assigned the kick value to the glow level in the bloom filter and used the "high" from the audio analysis to control the width of the lines.</p>
