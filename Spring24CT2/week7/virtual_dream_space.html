        <h1>Virtual Dream Space</h1>
        <p>I've always dreamed of having my own basketball court, and I thought that creating a basketball shooting interaction in Unity would present an intriguing challenge. My initial step involved designing the basketball court and the ball, after which I imported the Blender file into Unity. Following that, I developed the script to control the basketball's movement and utilized the PlayerFollowCamera and PlayerCapsule from Unity's first-person perspective example.</p>
