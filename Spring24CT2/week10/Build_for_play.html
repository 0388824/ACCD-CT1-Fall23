        <p>I got the idea by using a gyroscope sensor to control dancers' movements in a virtual club. But then, I ran into problems because I didn't have enough time to rig the characters to dance. So, I changed their movements to just simple left, right, and jump. After installing the sensor, I realized it worked better for controlling a car's chassis. This led me to make a dancing car, inspired by the lowriders in California.</p>
